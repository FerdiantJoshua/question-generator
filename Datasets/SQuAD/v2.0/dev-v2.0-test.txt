Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is generally considered to be the most basic iteration of a Turing machine?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a68", "answers": [{"text": "A deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "deterministic", "answer_start": 2}, {"text": "deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 2}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What fixed set of factors determine the actions of a deterministic Turing machine", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a69", "answers": [{"text": "rules", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "rules", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions", "answer_start": 76}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the term used to identify a deterministic Turing machine that has additional random bits?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a6a", "answers": [{"text": "A probabilistic Turing machine", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "probabilistic", "answer_start": 132}, {"text": "probabilistic Turing machine", "answer_start": 132}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of Turing machine is capable of multiple actions and extends into a variety of computational paths?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a6b", "answers": [{"text": "A non-deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "non-deterministic", "answer_start": 400}, {"text": "non-deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 400}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the term given to algorithms that utilize random bits?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a6c", "answers": [{"text": "randomized algorithms", "answer_start": 375}, {"text": "randomized algorithms", "answer_start": 375}, {"text": "randomized algorithms", "answer_start": 375}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 2}], "question": "What uses a flexible set of rules to determine its future actions?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac0e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "probabilistic Turing machine", "answer_start": 132}], "question": "What is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random ribbons?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac0f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The ability to make probabilistic decisions", "answer_start": 232}], "question": "What does not often help algorithms solve problems more efficiently?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac10", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "non-deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 400}], "question": "Which machine allows the machine to have multiple possible past actions from a given state?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac11", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches,", "answer_start": 632}], "question": "How is one way that one should not view non-determinism?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac12", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions.

Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What tactic did researchers employ to offset the former deficit of work surrounding the complexity of algorithmic problems?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c14", "answers": [{"text": "foundations were laid out", "answer_start": 110}, {"text": "numerous foundations were laid out", "answer_start": 101}, {"text": "numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the most influential researcher among those grappling with the deficit of work surrounding the complexity posed by algorithmic problems?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c15", "answers": [{"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}, {"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}, {"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What theoretical device is attributed to Alan Turing?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c16", "answers": [{"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}, {"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}, {"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year was the Alan Turing's definitional model of a computing device received?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c17", "answers": [{"text": "1936", "answer_start": 245}, {"text": "1936", "answer_start": 245}, {"text": "1936", "answer_start": 245}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In the most basic sense what did a Turing machine emulate?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c18", "answers": [{"text": "a computer", "answer_start": 319}, {"text": "a computer", "answer_start": 319}, {"text": "a computer", "answer_start": 319}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "foundations", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "What were laid out by various companies?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "foundations were laid out", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "What tactic did companies employ to offset the former deficit of work surrounding the complexity of algorithmic problems?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}], "question": "Who was the least influential researcher working on the complexity posed by algorithmic problems?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}], "question": "What device did Alan Turning invent in 1974?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "computer", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What was the Turning calculator a robust and flexible simplification of?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers.

ITV were the current rights holders, and fought hard to retain the new rights. ITV had increased its offer from \u00a318m to \u00a334m per year to keep control of the rights. BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid. The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paying \u00a3304m for the Premier League rights, would give them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992 season.  Murdoch described sport as a \"battering ram\" for pay-television, providing a strong customer base.

Various hypotheses have been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 1532) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten (literally housemates), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \"a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy\"). Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What helped spread Protestantism in France?", "id": "57106644b654c5140001f8e5", "answers": [{"text": "availability of the Bible in vernacular languages", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "the Bible in vernacular languages", "answer_start": 20}, {"text": "The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did the first French language bible appear?", "id": "57106644b654c5140001f8e6", "answers": [{"text": "Around 1294", "answer_start": 275}, {"text": "1294", "answer_start": 282}, {"text": "Around 1294", "answer_start": 275}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who translated this version of the scriptures?", "id": "57106644b654c5140001f8e7", "answers": [{"text": "Guyard de Moulin", "answer_start": 366}, {"text": "Guyard de Moulin", "answer_start": 366}, {"text": "Guyard de Moulin", "answer_start": 366}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "An illustrated, paraphrased version of this appeared when?", "id": "57106644b654c5140001f8e8", "answers": [{"text": "1487", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "1487", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "1487", "answer_start": 500}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Jean De Rely's illustrated French-language scriptures were first published in what city?", "id": "57106644b654c5140001f8e9", "answers": [{"text": "Paris", "answer_start": 491}, {"text": "Paris", "answer_start": 491}, {"text": "Paris", "answer_start": 491}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1294", "answer_start": 282}], "question": "In what year did the Protestant Reformation arrive in France?", "id": "5ad243abd7d075001a428a10", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 151}], "question": "In what country did the Protestant Reformation get its start?", "id": "5ad243abd7d075001a428a11", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1294", "answer_start": 282}], "question": "In what year did the Reformed church of France get established?", "id": "5ad243abd7d075001a428a12", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 151}], "question": "Where was the Roman Catholic Priest Guyard de Moulin from?", "id": "5ad243abd7d075001a428a13", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1487", "answer_start": 500}], "question": "Where was Jean de Rely from?", "id": "5ad243abd7d075001a428a14", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France.

The implication that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a \"combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground\", is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until first half of the eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What were the two Huguenot neighborhoods created in Berlin?", "id": "571099b2b654c5140001f9b3", "answers": [{"text": "Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What portion of Berlin's population spoke French by 1700?", "id": "571099b2b654c5140001f9b4", "answers": [{"text": "one-fifth", "answer_start": 101}, {"text": "one-fifth", "answer_start": 101}, {"text": "one-fifth", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why did Berlin Huguenots switch to German from French in their services?", "id": "571099b2b654c5140001f9b5", "answers": [{"text": "in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon", "answer_start": 299}, {"text": "in protest", "answer_start": 299}, {"text": "in protest against the occupation of Prussia by Napoleon", "answer_start": 299}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What years did this occupation take place?", "id": "571099b2b654c5140001f9b6", "answers": [{"text": "1806-07", "answer_start": 359}, {"text": "1806-07.", "answer_start": 359}, {"text": "1806-07", "answer_start": 359}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What other Northern European cities had Huguenot congregations?", "id": "571099b2b654c5140001f9b7", "answers": [{"text": "Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden", "answer_start": 480}, {"text": "Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden", "answer_start": 480}, {"text": "Fredericia (Denmark), Berlin, Stockholm, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Helsinki, and Emden", "answer_start": 480}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1806", "answer_start": 359}], "question": "In what year did Napoleon come to power in France?", "id": "5ad27294d7d075001a42949a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Dorotheenstadt", "answer_start": 57}], "question": "What neighborhood did Huguenots establish in Stockholm?", "id": "5ad27294d7d075001a42949b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Friedrichstadt", "answer_start": 76}], "question": "What neighborhood did Huguenots create in Hamburg?", "id": "5ad27294d7d075001a42949c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1700", "answer_start": 95}], "question": "When did Huguenots first arrive in Helsinki?", "id": "5ad27294d7d075001a42949d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "one-fifth", "answer_start": 101}], "question": "How much of Helsinki's population spoke French as of 1700?", "id": "5ad27294d7d075001a42949e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In Berlin, the Huguenots created two new neighbourhoods: Dorotheenstadt and Friedrichstadt.

The result is the multiple expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Along with poppet valve gears, what type of gears utilized separate admission and exhaust valves to give ideal events?", "id": "571136b8a58dae1900cd6d22", "answers": [{"text": "Corliss", "answer_start": 849}, {"text": "patent valve", "answer_start": 87}, {"text": "Corliss", "answer_start": 849}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with Stephenson and Walschaerts, what is an example of a simple motion?", "id": "571136b8a58dae1900cd6d23", "answers": [{"text": "Joy", "answer_start": 820}, {"text": "Joy", "answer_start": 820}, {"text": "Joy", "answer_start": 820}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How is lap provided by overlapping the admission side port?", "id": "571136b8a58dae1900cd6d24", "answers": [{"text": "lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve", "answer_start": 461}, {"text": "lengthening rubbing surfaces", "answer_start": 461}, {"text": "lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve", "answer_start": 461}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Corliss", "answer_start": 849}], "question": "What type of gears, along with poppet valve gears, utilized separate admission and leakage cutoffs to give ideal events?

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What are sometimes present in the boiler's firebox crown?", "id": "57113ba6b654c5140001fc1f", "answers": [{"text": "Lead fusible plugs", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Lead fusible plugs", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Lead fusible plugs", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What happens to the lead fusible plugs if the water level of the boiler drops?", "id": "57113ba6b654c5140001fc20", "answers": [{"text": "melts", "answer_start": 179}, {"text": "melts", "answer_start": 179}, {"text": "the lead melts", "answer_start": 170}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What happens after the lead melts?", "id": "57113ba6b654c5140001fc21", "answers": [{"text": "steam escapes", "answer_start": 193}, {"text": "steam escapes,", "answer_start": 193}, {"text": "the steam escapes", "answer_start": 189}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "After the operators are warned by the escape of the steam, what may they then do?", "id": "57113ba6b654c5140001fc22", "answers": [{"text": "manually suppress the fire", "answer_start": 244}, {"text": "manually suppress the fire", "answer_start": 244}, {"text": "manually suppress the fire", "answer_start": 244}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the escape of the steam unlikely to accomplish in all but the smallest boilers?", "id": "57113ba6b654c5140001fc23", "answers": [{"text": "dampening the fire", "answer_start": 344}, {"text": "dampening the fire", "answer_start": 344}, {"text": "dampening the fire", "answer_start": 344}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Lead fusible plugs", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What are sometimes present in the plug's firebox crown?", "id": "5ad40ec6604f3c001a40012f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "melts", "answer_start": 179}], "question": "What happens to the lead fusible plugs if the water level of the fire drops?", "id": "5ad40ec6604f3c001a400130", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "steam escapes", "answer_start": 193}], "question": "What happens after the firebox melts?", "id": "5ad40ec6604f3c001a400131", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "manually suppress the fire", "answer_start": 244}], "question": "After the operators are warned by the escape of the firebox, what may they then do?", "id": "5ad40ec6604f3c001a400132", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "dampening the fire", "answer_start": 344}], "question": "What is the escape of the firebox unlikely to accomplish in all but the smallest boilers?", "id": "5ad40ec6604f3c001a400133", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler's firebox.

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume.

A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant compared to that of an internal combustion engine?", "id": "5711607f2419e314009555cd", "answers": [{"text": "lower", "answer_start": 96}, {"text": "lower", "answer_start": 96}, {"text": "lower", "answer_start": 96}, {"text": "lower", "answer_start": 96}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with internal combustion engines, what machines have superseded steam in some areas?", "id": "5711607f2419e314009555ce", "answers": [{"text": "electric motors", "answer_start": 232}, {"text": "electric motors", "answer_start": 232}, {"text": "internal combustion engines or electric motors", "answer_start": 201}, {"text": "electric motors", "answer_start": 232}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What plants create most electric power?", "id": "5711607f2419e314009555cf", "answers": [{"text": "steam turbine", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "steam turbine", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "steam turbine plant", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "steam turbine plant", "answer_start": 297}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the movement that seeks renewed use of steam power in the modern era?", "id": "5711607f2419e314009555d0", "answers": [{"text": "Advanced Steam", "answer_start": 581}, {"text": "Advanced Steam movement", "answer_start": 581}, {"text": "cogeneration processes", "answer_start": 506}, {"text": "Advanced Steam movement", "answer_start": 581}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Along with fuel sources, what concern has contributed to the development of the Advanced Steam movement?", "id": "5711607f2419e314009555d1", "answers": [{"text": "pollution", "answer_start": 432}, {"text": "pollution", "answer_start": 432}, {"text": "Advanced Steam movement", "answer_start": 581}, {"text": "pollution", "answer_start": 432}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "lower", "answer_start": 96}], "question": "What is the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant compared to that of a steam engine?", "id": "5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fef9f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "electric motors", "answer_start": 232}], "question": "Along with internal combustion engines, what machines have superseded power in some areas?", "id": "5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "steam turbine", "answer_start": 297}], "question": "What plants create most combustion power?", "id": "5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Advanced Steam", "answer_start": 581}], "question": "What is the name of the movement that seeks renewed use of combustion power in the modern era?", "id": "5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "pollution", "answer_start": 432}], "question": "Along with fuel sources, what concern has contributed to the development of the combustion movement?", "id": "5ad3c3bc604f3c001a3fefa3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines.

Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What was the ultimate development of the horizontal engine?", "id": "5711628a2419e314009555dd", "answers": [{"text": "Corliss steam engine", "answer_start": 42}, {"text": "Corliss", "answer_start": 42}, {"text": "the Corliss steam engine", "answer_start": 38}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year was the Corliss engine patented?", "id": "5711628a2419e314009555de", "answers": [{"text": "1849", "answer_start": 76}, {"text": "1849", "answer_start": 76}, {"text": "1849", "answer_start": 76}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many valves did the Corliss engine use?", "id": "5711628a2419e314009555df", "answers": [{"text": "four", "answer_start": 94}, {"text": "four", "answer_start": 94}, {"text": "four", "answer_start": 94}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What award was given to Corliss?", "id": "5711628a2419e314009555e0", "answers": [{"text": "Rumford medal", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "Rumford medal", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "the Rumford medal", "answer_start": 234}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How much less steam did the Corliss engine use compared to the Watt engine?", "id": "5711628a2419e314009555e1", "answers": [{"text": "30%", "answer_start": 386}, {"text": "30% less steam", "answer_start": 386}, {"text": "30%", "answer_start": 386}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Corliss steam engine", "answer_start": 42}], "question": "What was the ultimate development of the vertical engine?", "id": "5ad3cb62604f3c001a3ff111", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1849", "answer_start": 76}], "question": "In what year was the Rumford engine patented?", "id": "5ad3cb62604f3c001a3ff112", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "four", "answer_start": 94}], "question": "How many valves did the Rumford engine use?", "id": "5ad3cb62604f3c001a3ff113", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Rumford medal", "answer_start": 238}], "question": "What award was inspired by Corliss?", "id": "5ad3cb62604f3c001a3ff114", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "30%", "answer_start": 386}], "question": "How much less steam did the Rumford engine use compared to the Watt engine?", "id": "5ad3cb62604f3c001a3ff115", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The acme of the horizontal engine was the Corliss steam engine, patented in 1849, which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff.

It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.[citation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the Rankine cycle sometimes called?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54adf", "answers": [{"text": "practical Carnot cycle", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "practical Carnot cycle", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "a practical Carnot cycle", "answer_start": 46}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where does heat rejection occur in the Rankine cycle?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae0", "answers": [{"text": "in the condenser", "answer_start": 240}, {"text": "in the condenser", "answer_start": 240}, {"text": "in the condenser", "answer_start": 240}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does isobaric mean?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae1", "answers": [{"text": "constant pressure", "answer_start": 272}, {"text": "constant pressure", "answer_start": 272}, {"text": "constant pressure", "answer_start": 272}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a term that means constant temperature?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae2", "answers": [{"text": "isothermal", "answer_start": 326}, {"text": "isothermal", "answer_start": 326}, {"text": "isothermal", "answer_start": 326}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In the Rankine cycle, in what state is the working fluid received in the condenser?", "id": "5711669550c2381900b54ae3", "answers": [{"text": "liquid", "answer_start": 506}, {"text": "a liquid", "answer_start": 504}, {"text": "gaseous", "answer_start": 704}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "practical Carnot cycle", "answer_start": 48}], "question": "What is the cycle condenser sometimes called?", "id": "5ad414dd604f3c001a4002c7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "in the condenser", "answer_start": 240}], "question": "Where does heat rejection occur in the Rankine cycle?", "id": "5ad414dd604f3c001a4002c8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "constant pressure", "answer_start": 272}], "question": "What does Carnot mean?", "id": "5ad414dd604f3c001a4002c9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "isothermal", "answer_start": 326}], "question": "What is a term that means constant energy?", "id": "5ad414dd604f3c001a4002ca", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "liquid", "answer_start": 506}], "question": "In the Rankine cycle, in what state is the working fluid received in the steam?", "id": "5ad414dd604f3c001a4002cb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages."}]}, {"title": "Oxygen", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "The atomic number of the periodic table for oxygen?", "id": "571a484210f8ca1400304fbd", "answers": [{"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the second most abundant element?", "id": "571a484210f8ca1400304fbe", "answers": [{"text": "helium", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "helium", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "helium", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "helium", "answer_start": 331}, {"text": "helium", "answer_start": 331}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere?", "id": "571a484210f8ca1400304fbf", "answers": [{"text": "Diatomic oxygen", "answer_start": 485}, {"text": "Diatomic oxygen", "answer_start": 485}, {"text": "Diatomic oxygen gas", "answer_start": 485}, {"text": "Diatomic oxygen", "answer_start": 485}, {"text": "Diatomic oxygen gas", "answer_start": 485}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many atoms combine to form dioxygen?", "id": "571a484210f8ca1400304fc0", "answers": [{"text": "two atoms", "answer_start": 377}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 377}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 377}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 377}, {"text": "two", "answer_start": 377}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Roughly, how much oxygen makes up the Earth crust?", "id": "571a484210f8ca1400304fc1", "answers": [{"text": "almost half", "answer_start": 788}, {"text": "almost half", "answer_start": 788}, {"text": "half", "answer_start": 795}, {"text": "almost half", "answer_start": 788}, {"text": "half", "answer_start": 795}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the atomic number of the element oxygen?", "id": "571c3a685efbb31900334db2", "answers": [{"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}, {"text": "8", "answer_start": 61}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Of what group in the periodic table is oxygen a member?", "id": "571c3a685efbb31900334db3", "answers": [{"text": "chalcogen", "answer_start": 86}, {"text": "chalcogen", "answer_start": 86}, {"text": "chalcogen", "answer_start": 86}, {"text": "chalcogen", "answer_start": 86}, {"text": "the chalcogen group", "answer_start": 82}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of compounds does oxygen most commonly form?", "id": "571c3a685efbb31900334db4", "answers": [{"text": "oxides", "answer_start": 216}, {"text": "oxides", "answer_start": 216}, {"text": "oxides", "answer_start": 216}, {"text": "oxide compounds", "answer_start": 737}, {"text": "oxide", "answer_start": 737}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Compared to other elements, how abundant does oxygen rank?", "id": "571c3a685efbb31900334db5", "answers": [{"text": "third", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "third-most", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "third", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "third-most", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "third", "answer_start": 267}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under normal conditions, what do two atoms of oxygen form?", "id": "571c3a685efbb31900334db6", "answers": [{"text": "dioxygen", "answer_start": 415}, {"text": "diatomic gas", "answer_start": 450}, {"text": "dioxygen", "answer_start": 415}, {"text": "dioxygen", "answer_start": 415}, {"text": "dioxygen", "answer_start": 415}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Oxygen", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What element has an atomic symbol of O?", "id": "5ad21646d7d075001a4283c4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Oxygen", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What element has a symbol number of 8?", "id": "5ad21646d7d075001a4283c5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "oxygen", "answer_start": 253}], "question": "What is the most abundant element in the universe followed by hydrogen and helium?", "id": "5ad21646d7d075001a4283c6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Diatomic oxygen", "answer_start": 485}], "question": "What constitutes 28.0% of the Earth's atmosphere?", "id": "5ad21646d7d075001a4283c7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8.

Because of its unpaired electrons, triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules, which have paired electron spins; this prevents spontaneous combustion."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Lavoisier conclude was consumed by combustion in his experiments?", "id": "571c8eb9dd7acb1400e4c0f6", "answers": [{"text": "air", "answer_start": 149}, {"text": "air", "answer_start": 234}, {"text": "air", "answer_start": 234}, {"text": "part of the trapped air", "answer_start": 214}, {"text": "air", "answer_start": 234}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what way did Lavoisier see that the tin he used in his experiment had increased?", "id": "571c8eb9dd7acb1400e4c0f7", "answers": [{"text": "weight", "answer_start": 301}, {"text": "weight", "answer_start": 301}, {"text": "weight", "answer_start": 301}, {"text": "that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in", "answer_start": 312}, {"text": "the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in", "answer_start": 276}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did Lavoisier perceive the air had lost as much as the tin had gained", "id": "571c8eb9dd7acb1400e4c0f8", "answers": [{"text": "weight", "answer_start": 346}, {"text": "weight", "answer_start": 301}, {"text": "weight", "answer_start": 346}, {"text": "weight", "answer_start": 346}, {"text": "weight", "answer_start": 346}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Lavoisier publish his work on combustion?", "id": "571c8eb9dd7acb1400e4c0f9", "answers": [{"text": "1777", "answer_start": 507}, {"text": "1777", "answer_start": 507}, {"text": "1777", "answer_start": 507}, {"text": "1777", "answer_start": 507}, {"text": "1777", "answer_start": 507}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What second part of air was deemed lifeless by Lavoisier?", "id": "571c8eb9dd7acb1400e4c0fa", "answers": [{"text": "azote", "answer_start": 640}, {"text": "azote", "answer_start": 640}, {"text": "azote", "answer_start": 640}, {"text": "azote", "answer_start": 640}, {"text": "azote", "answer_start": 640}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "azote", "answer_start": 640}], "question": "What is another term for vital air?", "id": "5ad2381dd7d075001a42882a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Azote", "answer_start": 701}], "question": "What is the English word for nitrogen?", "id": "5ad2381dd7d075001a42882b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1777", "answer_start": 507}], "question": "When was the book, Sur, published?", "id": "5ad2381dd7d075001a42882c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In one experiment, Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container.

Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust.

This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O\n2 or O\n3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel.

Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Electrolysis of what can be used to produce oxygen and hydrogen?", "id": "571ccfbadd7acb1400e4c164", "answers": [{"text": "water", "answer_start": 56}, {"text": "water", "answer_start": 56}, {"text": "water", "answer_start": 56}, {"text": "water", "answer_start": 56}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does the electrolysis of water produce?", "id": "571ccfbadd7acb1400e4c165", "answers": [{"text": "oxygen and hydrogen", "answer_start": 77}, {"text": "oxygen and hydrogen", "answer_start": 77}, {"text": "molecular oxygen and hydrogen", "answer_start": 67}, {"text": "molecular oxygen and hydrogen", "answer_start": 67}, {"text": "Oxygen gas", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of electric current is needed for electrolysis?", "id": "571ccfbadd7acb1400e4c166", "answers": [{"text": "DC", "answer_start": 98}, {"text": "DC electricity", "answer_start": 98}, {"text": "DC", "answer_start": 98}, {"text": "DC electricity", "answer_start": 98}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the source of oxygen production through electrocatalytic means?", "id": "571ccfbadd7acb1400e4c167", "answers": [{"text": "oxides and oxoacids", "answer_start": 535}, {"text": "oxides and oxoacids", "answer_start": 535}, {"text": "oxides and oxoacids", "answer_start": 535}, {"text": "oxides and oxoacids", "answer_start": 535}, {"text": "oxides and oxoacids", "answer_start": 535}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What other catalysts can be used to produce oxygen?", "id": "571ccfbadd7acb1400e4c168", "answers": [{"text": "Chemical", "answer_start": 556}, {"text": "Chemical", "answer_start": 556}, {"text": "Chemical", "answer_start": 556}, {"text": "chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles", "answer_start": 607}, {"text": "Chemical", "answer_start": 556}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "oxygen and hydrogen", "answer_start": 77}], "question": "What can be produced through electrolysis of molecular water?", "id": "5ad25d05d7d075001a428ed0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1", "answer_start": 142}], "question": "Why must DC electricity not be used?", "id": "5ad25d05d7d075001a428ed1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles", "answer_start": 607}], "question": "What chemical catalysts can be used in electrocatalytic O2 evolution?", "id": "5ad25d05d7d075001a428ed2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [], "question": "What do oxoacids evolve from?", "id": "5ad25d05d7d075001a428ed3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen.

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year. In November 2010, Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program, describing Iran as \"a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.\""}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which sized cars were the least demanded cars in the crisis?", "id": "5726581fdd62a815002e823a", "answers": [{"text": "large cars", "answer_start": 34}, {"text": "large", "answer_start": 34}, {"text": "large", "answer_start": 34}, {"text": "large", "answer_start": 34}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country's cars became more highly sought after as they were more fuel efficient?", "id": "5726581fdd62a815002e823b", "answers": [{"text": "Japanese imports", "answer_start": 46}, {"text": "Japan", "answer_start": 46}, {"text": "Japanese", "answer_start": 399}, {"text": "Japanese", "answer_start": 399}, {"text": "Japanese", "answer_start": 46}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of engines does the American car typically have?", "id": "5726581fdd62a815002e823c", "answers": [{"text": "V8 and six cylinder engines", "answer_start": 370}, {"text": "V8 and six cylinder", "answer_start": 370}, {"text": "V8 and six cylinder", "answer_start": 370}, {"text": "V8 and six cylinder", "answer_start": 370}, {"text": "V8 and six cylinder", "answer_start": 370}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country's imports became the de facto mass market leaders?", "id": "5726581fdd62a815002e823d", "answers": [{"text": "Japan", "answer_start": 399}, {"text": "Japan", "answer_start": 399}, {"text": "Japanese", "answer_start": 399}, {"text": "Japanese", "answer_start": 399}, {"text": "Japanese", "answer_start": 46}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "unibody construction and front-wheel drive", "answer_start": 448}], "question": "What standards did American cars create in the auto industry?", "id": "5a38cd93a4b263001a8c1929", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Toyota Corona, the Toyota Corolla", "answer_start": 78}], "question": "What are two cars with V8 engines that were more fuel efficient?", "id": "5a38cd93a4b263001a8c192a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "V8 and six cylinder", "answer_start": 370}], "question": "What type of unibody construction does an American car usually have?", "id": "5a38cd93a4b263001a8c192b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Japan", "answer_start": 46}], "question": "What country became a leader in importing large cars?", "id": "5a38cd93a4b263001a8c192c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The crisis", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What increased demand for cars with six cylinder engines?", "id": "5a38cd93a4b263001a8c192d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The crisis reduced the demand for large cars.
